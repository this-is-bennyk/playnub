## About

### What is Playnub?
The Playnub plugin is a collection of many general-purpose game development patterns, techniques, and tricks drawn from academia and online resources, as both a tool and a guide for creating games effectively and efficiently. Playnub is designed to expedite game development by providing tons of resources built specifically for rapid prototyping and continuous iteration-- enabling developers to focus on making the games they envision, not on programming the framework necessary to do so.

### Features

- Telemetry
  - Record continuous variables with just a few function calls
  - Create multiple tables of data
  - CSV, SQL file, and SQLite database support
- Behaviors
  - Action Lists: create discrete sequences of events in code
- Randomization
  - Fast normal distribution randomness
  - Complete and deck randomness
  - Generic weighted table
- And more!

### Future Plans
This project is currently in development and does not yet have a stable release. It will have one once it's in a good enough spot.  
The following is a list of things that I would like to implement into this project, time permitting:

- Automation
  - Record user input to a file
  - Play it back for testing/debugging, or for in-game replays
- Behaviors
  - Behavior Tree
  - Probability Curves
  - A* Planner
  - Steering Behaviors
  - Terrain Analysis and Layers
  - Vision Cones
